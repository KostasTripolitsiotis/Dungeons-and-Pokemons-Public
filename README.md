# Dungeons and Pokemons

Dungeons and Pokemons aims to be an app that adds the world of Pokemon to classic DnD 5e ruleset, with the ability to help even irl tables. 

## Description

Dungeons and Pokemons takes the stat blocks of Pokemon and translates those stats to DnD 5e numbers. Additionally, it creates, tracks and deletes those Pokemon along with their trainers. 

## Roadmap

As a final product, it aims to be used by the DM along with the players as a substitution of a Pokemon's character sheet. 
More specifically, for the DM, they will be able to spawn Pokemon based on existing or custom routes and monitor wild and captured Pokemon.
The players will be able to keep track of the stats and edit the battle effects on their captured Pokemon.
